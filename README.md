# Notes on MIT Distributed Systems Course

Notes and projects for my own self-study of [MIT 6.5840](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/). Using [this playlist of lectures](https://youtu.be/cQP8WApzIQQ?si=8ELRjd_hk1mRY1OZ).

I doubt the notes will make much sense for anyone besides me, they're really not meant to be. They exist only to aid me in my own learning process, not to digest it for others. Check out the course yourself! Or one of the many others like [this one](https://www.distributedsystemscourse.com/).
